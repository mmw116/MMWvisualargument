For my visual argument so far, I have added a businessman and a child. The idea for my project is that we trade in our inner child for adult life and lose touch with the magic and things we used to love. My goal is to show this by adding a briefcase will papers,etc. in the mans hand, ready to trade with the child who will be holding a backpack filled with child things like flowers, toys,etc.
